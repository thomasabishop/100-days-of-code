## One Hundred Days of Code: Interim Foci

**From September through most of October 2019 I want to set a series of interim goals. These combine skills across my languages and all relate closely to each other.**

These are also abilities and skills that I will need to use frequently in my new job so it makes sense to tackle them as a determined block. In my Notion notes I will use the emoji ðŸ”Žto designate topics that belong to these foci.

## Topics

### CSS 

#### Flexbox and Grid
* ~~Revise CSS Flexbox and focus especially on practising `shrink` and `grow`~~
* ~~Develop example layouts using Flexbox~~
* Combine Flexbox rules with CSS Grid for smooth transitions and resizing
* Learn enough CSS grid to be able to create responsive and fixed layouts
* Example custom component libraries on CodePen for, e.g. buttons, menu-bars, accordions, callouts, with consistent friendly styling.

#### Responsive design grids 
* Learn how to make responsive design grids using native CSS tools, e.g 12-by-12

#### Transitions
* Learn how to use the `transition` property (outside of animation) to manage event changes and other user interaction smoothly (e.g. dropdowns, changes in visibility, contractions/extensions).

### SCSS
* Mixins
    * Learn how to use properly, why they are useful and familiarize with most common use-cases.
* Extensions
    * What are the performance drawbacks of this Sass component?
    * In light of drawbacks, how can it be used responsibly/sparingly?
* Operators 
    * Learn how to use maths operators to create responsive layouts/grids, in line with CSS goals above
* Research 'cool Sass techniques' in order to identify handy features that I do not know about, like `lighten` for example. 

### JavaScript 
**Now that I have the theory of DOM manipulation in place, the next step is to practice it, but adding/removing nodes is fairly boring, so I need to learn events in order to combine DOM alteration with interesting and real use cases.**
* Events
    * Read through dedicated Duckett chapter and make notes
    * Learn about adding/removing classes in response to events
    * Tracking events related to form input types like radio-buttons and selectors
    * JavaScript form handling as it relates to events


## Applications
**What will I create in order to learn the above topics?**

* A Codepen collection called 'Layouts'
* A Tarot card app which will help me learn event management through a framework (Isotope), plus utilise Grid, Flexbox and advanced SCSS
* Detailed notes in Notion
