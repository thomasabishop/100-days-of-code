### Day 6: Saturday, 24 August 2019


**Today's Progress**: 
* I solved a practice exercise to calculate the median value for a given array of integers.
* I continued to practise DOM manipulation: adding nodes and started to learn the styling syntax which is pretty straightforward. Basically `node -> style -> color/fontSize etc`.
* I also answered a question on S.O. That way the 75 minutes I spent trying to get VS Code to allow me to use a custom font for comments is my gift to future generations hehe.

**Supplementary**: 
* I found the median exercise tough because placement is important to calculate this kind of average. How do you define 'the middle of the integer sequence' in JS? On the face of it, this doesn't look like something that can be derived purely mathematically. I found a way by filtering my function into two control flows, depending on whether the total number of integers was odd or even (using modulus to derive a 1 for odd and 0 for even). From this I found a way to find the middle value and then apply this to the array.
* I found that you cannot use the DOM manipulation method `node.querySelectorAll()` and then expect whatever change you make to apply automatically to all the matches of the query. This is because the method returns the matches as an array. So, once you have made your selection and match, you must then apply the alteration to each element in the array using a `foreach` loop.

### Day 10: Wednesday, 28 August 2019 

**Today's Progress**: 
* No JS today as I was occupied with redoing my CV and drafting cover letters for jobs. I am using LaTeX to typeset my resume so I managed to link it to 100 Days of Code by setting up LaTeX to run locally in VS Code, not in Overleaf.
* This also gave me the idea to develop a 'GitHub' style template for LaTeX which could be useful when I want to print written content very clearly with minimal styling.

**Link to work:** 
* [Resume repository](https://github.com/thomasabishop/thomas-resume)


### Day 11: Thursday, 29 August 2019 

**Today's Progress**: 
* Wrote up notes on `this`                                                                                                                             
### Day 12: Friday, 30 August 2019 

**Today's Progress**: 
* Completed gratuity calculator code challenge in the morning. Now I have the script I will turn this into a CodePen showcase with a GUI soon.
* Started writing up Duckett notes.
* Got a bit waylaid by deliving into Iffy's but it was educative. See below...
* Created comparisons for the different types of function.

**Specific learnings**:
* You can group related functions into one and use an array to distinguish the calls. See [prism.js](week_2/prism.js)
* You can use both anonymous functions and immediately-invoked functions as methods in objects.
* Whilst iffy's are immediately invoked, you can in fact hold them in a variable, however, **the variable does not store the function, it stores the value it generates**.

### Day 17: Wednesday, 4 September 2019 
**Today's Progress**: 
* Mainly occupied with preparing for job interview but built a mock-up of the coding dashboard I want to build with Vue for my  site. It uses static JSON data for now and standard JS. I used CSS Grid combined with Flexbox for the layout. Plus Charts.js

### Day 18: Friday, 6 September 2019 

**Today's Progress**: 
* On a bit of a high from good news about job.
* I started a small static site called *Flexbox Toolkit* which is to help me real nail-down my use of Flexbox. Also it might help others and lead to some collaboration if it fills a need.
* Wrote a tiny bit of pointless JS too.

### Day 19: Saturday, 7 September 2019 

**Today's Progress**: 
* Worked on the logo to *Flexbox Toolkit*
* Refined notes on the DOM. Added examples of inline styling via DOM nodes and made a CodePen demo of retrieving layout data about elements from DOM node properties.
* Set up a local dev environment (for *Flexbox Toolkit*) using Webpack to manage:
    * Instant reloading
    * SCSS compilation 
    * HTML minification
* I feel good about this as it will serve me well on other projects. I used this [excellent guide](https://hackernoon.com/lets-start-with-webpack-4-91a0f1dba02e) which is straightforward and works without errors.
* Tomorrow I want to use Webpack to build the 'Operator Mono' webfonts that I am going to use for *Flexbox Toolkit*. I also want to see what other processes (for instance SVG Go compression) I can automate by adding to the  Webpack pipeline.

* [Quotient](https://github.com/thomasabishop/quotient)


### Day 23: Wednesday, 11 September 2019 

**Today's Progress**: 
* From my activities at the Blueprint trial I am now quite capable of setting up a Node.js and Webpack-based static website. This is something that I will have to do as a matter of routine in my new job.
* It is very straightforward so long as you clone the Node `settings.json` and `webpack.config.js` and of course have Node installed for the modules that these files refer to. 

### Day 24: Sunday, 15 September 2019 

**Today's Progress**: 
* Wrote detailed notes on collaborative Git and the Gitflow collaborative methodology.
* Started refactoring the FMP SCSS for Blueprint.

**Today's Progress**: 
* Practised methods of the global objects `String`, `Number`, `Math`

**Link to work:** 
* [Number_methods](week_5/Number_methods.js)
* [String_methods](week_5/Number_methods.js)

### Day 29: Friday, 20 September 2019 

**Today's Progress**: 
* Learned about the `Date` global object and it's various methods.
* Added 'GitHub Projects' section to professional website, ready to showcase Quotient and Sine Qua Non.  

**Summary of Learning**
* The trick is to create a variable that stores the current time and then build your data off of that.
* We create the variable using constructor notation: `var today = new Date();`
* We can use built-in stringifying methods like `toDateString()` or `toDateString()` or we can build-out our own date from methods like `getFullYear()` or `getMonth()` and then wrap them in `toString()`. For example:
```
let hour = today.getHours(); 
let mins = today.getMinutes();

console.log("The time is " + hour.toString() + ':' + mins.toString() );
```

### Day 32: Friday, 27 September 2019 

*N.B* Have been very bad this week and missed lots of days. This is because I started my new job and am also ill. I've simply stopped the clock but am hoping to get my consistency back this week.

**Today's Progress**: 
* Spent a long time playing about with a flexbox layout.
* I want to master layouts in:
    * Flexbox alone (pretty much there)
    * CSS Grid alone 
    * CSS Grid and flexbox together
* Tomorrow, add JavaScript to toggle buttons.

### Day 33: Saturday, 28 September 2019 

**Today's Progress**: 

* Not very well unfortunately and this has slowed me down. But I have been learning Sass on a deeper level today and have finally taken the trouble to learn all possible uses of mixins. I will now use them frequently especially at the config stage of a new project. Going to try and refactor some recent code too.
* Before looking at Sass I made a proper plan for my #100DaysofCode aims in October. This is mainly related to work technologies or nailing existing skills that I will be expected to use at a more advanced and less verbose level. Feels good to have this set out as it will help me stay on focus if I have to lose days in the next month due to work commitments 

**Link to work:** 
* [Interim foci (October) ](interim-foci-sept-oct.md)

### Day 34: Sunday, 29 September 2019 

**Today's Progress**: 

* Finally worked out how to flip between git identities easily with SSH. This means I can jump between machines more easily without losing track of my work. Made detailed notes on it too, so I can do again when necessary. I can also log to here from my work machine without conflicts, which is handy because I put my desktop machine away for work days. 
* Continued learning more advanced uses of SCSS. There are lots of built in functions for colours that will be really helpful when trying to demonstrate states in UI interfaces. 
* Going to make use of this knowledge when I start building my mini component libraries on CodePen. As long as I declare generic variables like `$primary-colour` and `$accent-colour` at the beginning, I will in theory just be able to feed in a palette of hexcodes and have all the details taken care of.

### Day 35: Monday, 30 September 2019 

**Today's Progress**: 

* Continued learning more advanced Sass techniques:
    * media queries 
    * conditionals
    * loops
    * string interpolation
* Started optimising the SCSS of a layout I built recently. Really enjoyed it and was able to greatly simplify the styling using the new features I have learned. 

### Day 36: Tuesday, 01 October 2019 

**Today's Progress**: 

* Working on lots of niggly tweaks at work today. I built a slanted button though which will have to count as my self-directed coding for today.

**Link to work:** 
* [slanted_rectangle](https://codepen.io/thomasabishop/pen/OJLeqMa)

### Day 43: Friday, 11 October 2019 

**Today's Progress**: 
* Finished notes on CSS Grid. Now feel equipped to use it. 
* Made great progress on button components. Very happy with it. Think it is a really useful exercise to build common components entirely from scratch in a style that is pleasingly neutral. 
* Also added JS independently. 
* Good day in code terms.

### Day 45: Sunday, 13 October 2019 

**Today's Progress**: 
* Set up code highlighting on buttons. Originally thought of using an `.svg` from Carbon but that came out as a mahusive file that didn't render. So I did what I should've done first and used the CDN of a JS highlighter: highlight.js.
* This rendered the snippets within `<code><pre>...</pre></code>` as highlighted CSS code. But I thought I hit a problem in that the code had to be either rendered as a light or dark theme. I needed it to be light when the sun icon wasn't active and dark when the moon icon wasn't active. That way it would coincide with the light/dark controls. So I worked out how to target the `href` attribute of the highlight.js stylesheet, then used an `if` conditon to set the stylesheet programmatically. 
* Really pleased. Now need to extract what I have learned from the work into notes and then go on and make more components.

### Day 48: Friday, 25 October 2019 

**Today's Progress**: 
* Decided to take a break from the daily logs this week. I've still been coding but I've been busy with days in the office and so forth.
* Completed the single page layout with hidden side navigation.
* Started trying to address the difficulties I have been having with Grid by studying it again. 

**Link to work:** 
* * [Single page layout with hidden side nav](https://codepen.io/thomasabishop/pen/mddyyBG)

### Day 49: Saturday, 26 October 2019 

**Today's Progress**: 
* Reviewed my previous notes on CSS Grid, improved and added additional notes on topics I have found tricky. 
* Learnt the shorthands for the major grid properties which will help to make my CSS terser. 
* Started learning how to actually use grids for graphic design. Once I understand the design principles (the different ratios of column to row etc, how to manage gutters), I can use them to make my CSS better and to actually have a reason for the different layouts I will create with CSS Grid. Once this knowledge is assimilated I will make grid templates in Codepen so that I can quickly fork them in projects. May do the same with *Sine Qua Non*.

### Day 55: Sunday, 03 November 2019 

**Today's Progress**: 

* Wrote blog post summarising the second month of the 100 Days of Code Challenge. Useful to reflect on what I have learned and gained. Also wanted to make some style changes to site but will wait until tomorrow.


### Day 56: Wednesday, 06 November 2019 

**Today's Progress**: 

* Worked on site in evening.

* In the day teaching myself the foundations of ASP.NET and Umbraco ready for course next week. Work have allowed me to do some self-directed learning which is really great.


### Day 57: Thursday, 07 November 2019 

**Today's Progress**: 

* Got lots of hands-on experience of Umbraco today and was able to make several fixes to client's sites.
* Completed accordion in evening.
* Started on card components on CodePen.

### Day 59: Saturday, 09 November 2019 

**Today's Progress**: 

* Set-up .NET Core for Mac-based .NET development and to have an environment to practise C# and Razor with. I can't run a dummy Umbraco site because it requires an IIS Windows server but it is still useful to learn the infrastructure and `dotnet` CLI. 
* Started making some card/callout components on the side.

### Day 60: Sunday, 10 November 2019 

**Today's Progress**: 

* Tidied up the code of Mr Robot Character Matrix.
* Set-up Isotope and spent a great deal of time trying to get the Isotope grid it align within its container. Then I discovered that that capability (`fitColumns`) requires a separate module. I imported this module's code into the Codepen and it aligned. Next I need to apply the filters and sort functions and also source the images and learn CSS `clip-path`.

### Day 71: Sunday, 24 November 2019 
* Continued working through Umbraco data structures but stopped as I realised I needed a more formal guide to C# than the scattered web guides so I ordered a code book. Will come back to this once it arrives. 
* Started researching the prototype basis of JavaScript. This is really helping me understand the adage that everything apart from primitives in JS is an object and also how class-like behaviour can be achieved with it. 
* Set up _Autopoesis_ as a Gatsby.js site. Going to work through the Gatsby tutorials on a dummy site to learn the ropes. This will help me understand my own site structure better and is a good bridge to eventually engaging with React. Now thinking React is a better bet in terms of career and employability than Vue. 

### Day 72: Monday, 25 November 2019 
* Completed my notes on JS prototypes. Took things as far as I could without getting bogged-down in complexities that would just confuse me at this point in my knowledge. I think it was a useful foundation that will be helpful when working with C# and languages with proper classes. 


### Days 73/74: Friday, 29 - Saturday,  30 November 2019 

* Started to learn Vim. Then realised that it works best with QWERTY and that I had totally forgotten the letter placment since I switched to Dvorak. So I've had to refactor and am now learning to touchtype QWERTY. I'm interested in whether my brain can handle it, i.e whether it is cognitively possible to have muscle-reflex memory for two distinct arrangements embodied in the same physical form. We'll see. I really hope so because I don't want to forget Dvorak after all the effort it took to learn it. 

* Decided to continue with learning Gatsby and pleased to notice that it's quite easy and that I'm increasingly seeing the broad function similarities accross languages and frameworks. Also gentle way to familiarise with React which I shall have to learn at some point.

### Day 75 Sunday 1 December 2019
* Continued with Gatsby notes. Covered using props and linking between pages, then practised with my dummy Gatsby install.
* Started designing _Autopoesis_ in Sketch
