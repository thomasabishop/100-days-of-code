### Day 6: Saturday, 24 August 2019


**Today's Progress**: 
* I solved a practice exercise to calculate the median value for a given array of integers.
* I continued to practise DOM manipulation: adding nodes and started to learn the styling syntax which is pretty straightforward. Basically `node -> style -> color/fontSize etc`.
* I also answered a question on S.O. That way the 75 minutes I spent trying to get VS Code to allow me to use a custom font for comments is my gift to future generations hehe.

**Supplementary**: 
* I found the median exercise tough because placement is important to calculate this kind of average. How do you define 'the middle of the integer sequence' in JS? On the face of it, this doesn't look like something that can be derived purely mathematically. I found a way by filtering my function into two control flows, depending on whether the total number of integers was odd or even (using modulus to derive a 1 for odd and 0 for even). From this I found a way to find the middle value and then apply this to the array.
* I found that you cannot use the DOM manipulation method `node.querySelectorAll()` and then expect whatever change you make to apply automatically to all the matches of the query. This is because the method returns the matches as an array. So, once you have made your selection and match, you must then apply the alteration to each element in the array using a `foreach` loop.

### Day 7: Sunday, 25 August 2019 

**Today's Progress**: 
* I updated all columns in my _Built-in properties and methods_ Notion spreadsheet, improving the syntax and including the full technical name for each method.
* I attempted to refine the medians script. I succeeded but only reduced the code a little bit.
* I installed Gatsby and started working on vers. 2.0 of my professional site.

### Day 8: Monday, 26 August 2019 

**Today's Progress**: 
* I spent the day book-studying with Duckett. I learned about `this` and **constructor syntax** for objects and classes.
* I worked on my Gatsby.js professional site.

### Day 9: Tuesday, 27 August 2019 

**Today's Progress**: 
* I started the day with some code exercises. Wasn't very happy with the results.

### Day 10: Wednesday, 28 August 2019 

**Today's Progress**: 
* No JS today as I was occupied with redoing my CV and drafting cover letters for jobs. I am using LaTeX to typeset my resume so I managed to link it to 100 Days of Code by setting up LaTeX to run locally in VS Code, not in Overleaf.
* This also gave me the idea to develop a 'GitHub' style template for LaTeX which could be useful when I want to print written content very clearly with minimal styling.

### Day 11: Thursday, 29 August 2019 

**Today's Progress**: 
* Wrote up notes on `this`                                                                                                                              


### Day 12: Friday, 30 August 2019 

**Today's Progress**: 
* Completed gratuity calculator code challenge in the morning. Now I have the script I will turn this into a CodePen showcase with a GUI soon.
* Started writing up Duckett notes.
* Got a bit waylaid by deliving into Iffy's but it was educative. See below...
* Created comparisons for the different types of function.

**Specific learnings**:
* You can group related functions into one and use an array to distinguish the calls. See [prism.js](week_2/prism.js)
* You can use both anonymous functions and immediately-invoked functions as methods in objects.
* Whilst iffy's are immediately invoked, you can in fact hold them in a variable, however, **the variable does not store the function, it stores the value it generates**.

### Day 15: Monday, 2 September 2019 

**Today's Progress**: 
* Busy with job applications.
* Completed styling of gratuity calculator; just need to add JS now.
* Started on another mini-project: getting an image to change shope and proportion based on slider input.

### Day 16: Tuesday, 3 September 2019 

**Today's Progress**:

### Day 17: Wednesday, 4 September 2019 
**Today's Progress**: 
* Mainly occupied with preparing for job interview but built a mock-up of the coding dashboard I want to build with Vue for my  site. It uses static JSON data for now and standard JS. I used CSS Grid combined with Flexbox for the layout. Plus Charts.js

### Day 18: Friday, 6 September 2019 

**Today's Progress**: 
* On a bit of a high from good news about job.
* I started a small static site called *Flexbox Toolkit* which is to help me real nail-down my use of Flexbox. Also it might help others and lead to some collaboration if it fills a need.
* Wrote a tiny bit of pointless JS too.

### Day 19: Saturday, 7 September 2019 

**Today's Progress**: 
* Worked on the logo to *Flexbox Toolkit*
* Refined notes on the DOM. Added examples of inline styling via DOM nodes and made a CodePen demo of retrieving layout data about elements from DOM node properties.
* Set up a local dev environment (for *Flexbox Toolkit*) using Webpack to manage:
    * Instant reloading
    * SCSS compilation 
    * HTML minification
* I feel good about this as it will serve me well on other projects. I used this [excellent guide](https://hackernoon.com/lets-start-with-webpack-4-91a0f1dba02e) which is straightforward and works without errors.
* Tomorrow I want to use Webpack to build the 'Operator Mono' webfonts that I am going to use for *Flexbox Toolkit*. I also want to see what other processes (for instance SVG Go compression) I can automate by adding to the  Webpack pipeline.

### Day 21: Monday, 9 September 2019 

**Today's Progress**: 
* Wrote notes on global objects: `String`, `Number`, `Math`
* Familiarised with UI-Kit, which I need to know for trial day - started building an analytics dashboard.

### Day 22: Tuesday, 10 September 2019 

**Today's Progress**: 
* Built homepage template (called *Quotient* ) in order to practise UI-Kit. Based on magazine style website. Quite rough and ready and no linked pages but a useful exercise.

### Day 23: Wednesday, 11 September 2019 

**Today's Progress**: 
* From my activities at the Blueprint trial I am now quite capable of setting up a Node.js and Webpack-based static website. This is something that I will have to do as a matter of routine in my new job.
* It is very straightforward so long as you clone the Node `settings.json` and `webpack.config.js` and of course have Node installed for the modules that these files refer to. 

### Day 24: Sunday, 15 September 2019 

**Today's Progress**: 
* Wrote detailed notes on collaborative Git and the Gitflow collaborative methodology.
* Started refactoring the FMP SCSS for Blueprint.
